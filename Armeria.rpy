label to_the_schoolyard:
"Go home, human!"
"That's right! You don't belong here!"
"Hiss! Stay away from me, No Fur!"
"Dark silent glares peered onto Yoah as he walked with Armeria around the schoolyard."   
??? "Are you all right, Yoah?"
yoah "Yeah..."
"Yoah gulped as he speaks." 
"There were even many students that lingers around this place."
"Some whispered around him, while others glared at him."
"Yoah's body began to shake as the beast's threatening words of 'kill him', 'slaughter him', and 'take him to the pack'."
"This school... this negative energy towards Yoah."
"What did the humans do to make this like this?"
??? "Yoah!"
yoah "Huh? Did you say something?"
??? "I said..."
??? "My name is Armeria! What's yours?"
yoah "Oh, it's..."
yoah "Yoah..."
a "Yoah... what a wonderful name!"
a "I look forward becoming your new friend!"
"Yoah's ears perked, as if he were a beast himself. He looked up at Armeria, who was smiling back at him."
"Him? This plant monster? As his new friend?"
"Suddenly, his lips began to quiver. Forming a broad look that reflected Armeria's face just now."
a "Hahahaha! Wonderful!"
yoah "What is it?" 
a "Oh, it's just that I didn't think a human would smile on their first day!"
a "They would usually be confused or scared!"
yoah "Why should I be scared? It's exciting to be around non-human beings!"
yoah "No, wait. It's like a dream come true! I've always wanted to be the main protagonist in a game!"
yoah "Hmm... that's not right."
a "Ehehehe! For a human being whose life is in dangerous, you sure are a cheery one!"
yoah "Well, yeah! It's not always good to be scared of everything!"
yoah "I should always be positive no matter what happens! Don't you think so too?"
a "..."
"Armeria gasped lightly and widen his eyes."
"Not the type of reaction Yoah expected to be. Did he say something wrong?"
a "The sun is about to set. You would need to meet the Union soon."
yoah "The Union?"
a "Yes, you know these people who surrounds you? They are known as the Union."
a "You'll learn more about them as we listen to their words, understand?"
y "Okay!"
"Yoah jumped gleefully. The 'Union', a name he had never heard before."
"How exciting! He thought to himself."

not_so_good_first_day:
a "Good night."
y "Good night!"
y "Hooray! Let's see what my dorm looks like!"
"*Creck...."
"As soon as Yoah walked inside of his dorm. His legs began to stumble."
y "What the heck?"
"His vision spun around, and his stomach began to churn badly."
"Something was about to come out and so, he were straight to the toilet."
y "Ughhhh..."
y "What's wrong with me?"
"*Bam!*"
a "Yoah! Are you all right?!"
y "Ahhh! Armeria! Can't you knock before you come in?!"
a "Now is not the time for privacy matters! I heard moaning coming from your dorm room!"
a "I thought that you were dying from something, so I got scared."
"Yoah widen his eyes, as he gazed upon Armeria's worried expression."
y "(Can non-humans make that kind of expression?)"
y "(Of course they would, you big dummy!)"
y "(Wouldn't they worry about extinction or something?!)"
"Suddenly, his stomach start churning again and then his face was back on the tiolet."
a "Ah... so I see what's going on."
"Armeria pondered as he observed Yoah."
a "You poor thing! I see that you can't handle this either!"
y "What do you- blech!"
a "I'll keep this brief. It's the territorial markings these beasts made in order to keep you away."
a "As much as I want to take to you to nurse, but it's dangerous for you to go at this time..."
a "Hmmm..."
a "A moment, please."
"As Armeria left, Yoah let out another very unpleasant throw up."
y "Ugh... so that explains the weird smell going around my dorm."
y "Just when I was enjoying my new li- blech!"
a "Come with me."
"Armeria wrapped Yoah's arm around his shoulder and slowly walked with him."
"Pressing his body with his, a sweet scent wavered around the air."
"Honey..."
"Bees would always make those as food for humans."
"Looking at Armeria, there were many leaves and flowers that surrounded his entire body."
"Surprisely, his body was very soft. As if were cuddling a teddy bear, Yoah never wanted to let that go."
"***"
a "I'm afraid this last minute notice had lead to this."
a "You're going to have sleep on my bed."
y "What?! In your bed?!"
y "Why that sounds..."
y "Exciting! Woohoo!"
"Just when Yoah was about to jump there, he came to a halt."
"He turned his head to Armeria, who stood there smiling at him."
"Yoah wasn't sure if he is really smiling sarcastically or not. It seem very real to him..."
a "What's wrong, Yoah? Don't you want to try my bed out?"
y "Where are you going to sleep in?"
a "Oh, me? Don't worry about me! Since I am a plant, I can sleep in dirt from our garden to keep my moisten my stems." 
a "Although there is a mini cabin inside that garden..."
a "Oh no! I should be there to protect you!"
"As Armeria mumbles to him, Yoah looks over at his bed."
"It seemed to be a normal bed with a blanket that is neatly made."
"Almost as if he were trying to sleep as a human being?"
a "It's getting late. You should get some sleep."
y "*Yawn* you're right, I should."
"He never would have thought that he would be a bit exhausted right now."
"He climbed onto the bed, closing his eyes up and he wasn't able to open them for a little while."
"***"
"Opening his eyes again, he was in an unfamiliar room."
"Confused, he rubbed his eyes to make sure that he wasn't dreaming."
a "Good morning!"
y "(Nope, it wasn't a dream. Thank goodness for that!"
a "Here! I made you some breakfast! Hope you don't mind!"
y "Oh boy! I bet it's one of your plant people's daily breakfast!"
y "..."
y "..."
"It was just a regular porridge with blueberries and bananas, with a elegant piece of flower petal on the center of it as well."
a "Sorry, would you like for me to take it back?"
y "No! No! I'm okay with it! Really!"
y "I was hoping to try some of your food today!"
a "Not really. There are many unfamiliar fruits, liquids, and insects you may not recognized."
a "Some of them might not look very appetizing to you either."
y "What? I rather tried it anyway!"
y "Don't you remember what I said yesterday? I'm here to learn on what's been happening in this academy!"
y "Food counts, right?"
a "Hahahaha!"
"A gentle laugh escaped from Armeria's mouth. Perhaps he was happy and surprised at the same time because of Yoah's words."
"He did described Yoah as an interesting person yesterday. Of course, many humans wouldn't be as typical as he is."
"They would panic and even ask a bunch of questions as Armeria described yesterday."
a "You should eat your breakfast soon. We have lots to talk about after this."
y "Oh, sorry!"
"Taking his first bite, it was very sweet and cold."
"Even the blueberries and bananas tasted very fresh too."
y "It's delicious, but it is a bit cold."
a "Sorry, plant people such as I am cannot handle too much heat. That's why your food is a bit too cold for you."
y "Oh, sorry! I didn't mean to offend you!"
y "It's really good!"
a "I wasn't offended. Others would say the same thing whenever I make food."
a "I can make something other than porridge, however, we plant people cannot digest solid food due to our weak stomach."
y "Really? Hmm... I thought that plants would make their own food after being watered and be basked in the sunlight?"
a "Ah, that too. That's the plant's daily routine during the daytimes."
a "I would often see many plant students that would bring bottles of water and bathe in the sunlight from before and after classes for their own survivals."
a "We shouldn't use up too much of our time right now. Eat up and get ready soon."
y "Oh, okay..."
"Yoah's head drooped down. Just when he was learning more about his non-human race."
y "(Oh well, maybe we'll talk about it another time.)"
"As Yoah ate more of his porridge, he noticed a big smile from Armeria."
"***"
#Seeing that it was extremely dangerous for Yoah to be exposed to a normal class and dormitory, Ohla suggested that Yoah studied in the library and stayed at the Union Chamber to rest until the situation in the dormitory and the academy had been controlled.
"After that, Yoah and Armeria stepped out of Union Chambers and began to walk together."
"The once noisy hallway had become dead silent, which made Yoah gulped and froze."
a "What's wrong, Yoah?"
y "Oh, uhh..."
"Student #1" "Why is he so close to Armeria?"
y "Huh?"
"Suddenly, a loud whisper runs through his ears."
"Student #2" "And he's talking to him so casually!"
"Student #3" "A human is capable of tricking a monster's mind! They always pick the dirty words to say to gain their trust!"
"Student #3" "I worry for Armeria's safety."
"Yoah stopped his steps. He lowered his head, staring at the floor over nothing."
"Those students that worried about Armeria. He's that well-known to the academy? If he is, then hanging with him would worsen his reputation."
"Paying no mind to the harsh whispers, Armeria came towards him and gently touched his shoulder."
a "What's wrong, Yoah?"
"He looked at Yoah with worried eyes, surging surprised gasps and rising anger."
"Smelling the wonderful scent of honey around him. He opened his mouth..."

    "Armeria's smile faded, perhaps he didn't like that question."
    "It was a simple truth, Yoah didn't want to create any more burdens to his popularity."
    "He tried to open his mouth about it, but it never came out."
    a "I'm afraid I cannot do that, Yoah."
    y "Why not?"
    a "It's because I am part of the Union."
    y "What?! Why didn't you say so in the first place?!"
    a "If I ever did, then..."
    a "No, forget what I just said."
    y "Huh?"
    "Yoah cocked his head."
    "Yoah cocked his head."
    "Armeria suddenly became quiet, as if he were about to say something else."
    "Suddenly, he lifted his head back up and smiled."
    y "(That was strange. He's back in his old self again.)"
    y "(Hmm... I shouldn't pry into his business. I should ask him something else then.)"
    y "Then which position are you in?"

    y "What?! You were one of them?!"
    y "Why didn't you tell me in the first place?!"
    a "Apologies, my friend. I didn't want you know because...."
    "Armeria paused his words and he lowered his eyes."

    y "Then how come it's just you?"
    a "None of the other members have the skills to protect you properly."
    a "Oh, and that reminds me. I know we talked about this earlier, but I shouldn't take you to large scale places such as the cafeteria."
    a "Mostly everything else too. This school is not a very safe place to be in."
    y "Then where can I be safe?"
    a "With me, of course."
    y "Really?"
    a "..."
    "Suddenly, atmosphere suddenly changed. Yoah's teeth began to chattered, he even forced himself to wrap his arms around too."
    "It was cold, very cold... No one ever told him about this before."
    "Is this normal? Or is it..."
    "{i}Are you scared?{i}"
    y "What the?! Was that you, Armeria?"
    a "...!"
    a "..."
    "Armeria's expression suddenly changed."
    a "Don't move."
    "He raised his arm, reaching towards Yoah's shoulder."
    "Taking out a white, misty figure. He slammed it onto the wall."
    "The coldness had ceased. Yoah's body temperature was slowly going back to normal."
    a "You, Ghost! How did you get past the members of Union?!" 
    "Ghost" "Hey! I was skimming around without even touching anyone, so I was there just to scare the human! I swear!"
    a "You're lying! I can tell from those eyes of yours that tells me everything!"
    a "You there! Take him back to the Union chambers! We shall discussed his punishment after classes."
    a "All of you, keep your eyes and ears up, members! Make sure it doesn't happen again!"
    "The members nodded their head at Armeria, looking at him with worried eyes as if they were apologizing to him."
    "Yoah widen in surprise. Just looking on how much of his gentle personality that completely changed in a second."

    "Armeria continues to mumble to himself as he ponders."
    a "I would agree with you, Yoah."

   a "Don't mind them."
   "Two women came out from the back of the store, greeting Armeria and Yoah with beautiful smiles on their faces."
   "From the looks of them, they look identical to each other, Yoah can't tell which one is which."
   a "Yoah, these are my sisters, Tali and Lily."
   y "Hello!"
   "..."
   "In complete silent, Tali and Lily stared at him intently."
   "Yoah stood there, fidgetting his fingers while his heart beated fast."
   "Was there something with him? Was it because of his race?"
   "Tali" "Lily, aren't you going to get the ruler?"
   "Lily" "Weren't YOU going to go get it?"
   "Tali" "Excuse me, I'm actually thinking of an outfit for our human guest."
   "Lily" "Well, so am I!"
   a "Now, now you two. No fighting!"
   a "Pick an outfit that you two thinks is the best! Isn't that what you guys would always do?"
   "The two women widened their eyes and looked at each other. A few giggles came out of their lips, perhaps they were making each other up for fighting."
   "Turning their heads at Yoah, they walk towards him and instructed him to raise his arms and don't move."
   "Talis" "Hmm... I love a good challenge for someone like him!"
   "Lily "Yes indeed! I wouldn't pick a flower or sticks to put on the inside just because he's a human!"
   "Talis" "Yes, yes! Humans don't have branches or stems that can support the flowers!"
   "Talis" "We'll have to put it outside the clothing!"
   "Yoah smiled, reflecting their current expressions as they continued to measure every inch of his body."
   "After that, they hurried over to their counters and then they let Armeria helped them make some jewerlies."
   "Yoah, on the other hand had to watch them make the clothing."
   "They were afraid that some of the stuff would hurt him."
   "Sitting on a chair, Yoah watched as the three of them talked and laughed at fun conversations."

   a "Me? No, I have not."
   "Lily" "Really? You know, you should take a break once in a while!"
   "Talis" "Yeah, she would take care of you like we did when you were young!"
   "Lily" "We feed you, we watered you, and we played with you often!"
   "Talis" "Oh how I missed the times when Armeria would sometimes wet his bed whenever he gets a nightmare."
   "Talis" "He would want to buried his soil with our."
   a "What?! Why would you bring that up?"
   "Yoah widened his eyes as he faced Armeria with a reaction he had never seen before."
   "His face was completely red, even his leaves were rustling like crazy."
   y "(Do plants really react this way?)"
   "As soon as they made eye, Armeria tried his best smile at him."
   "It was trembling in embarassment. Yoah couldn't help but to giggle innocently a
   "Talis" "So Yoah, do you have any questions for us?"
   y "Huh?"
   "Lily" "Oh, yes! You should join in the conversation too!"
   "Lily" "We don't want you to get lonely!"
   y "Wow, thank you guys! Hmm... you see Armeria already answered a lot of my questions from the plant people."
   y "I might as well get to know you guys!"
