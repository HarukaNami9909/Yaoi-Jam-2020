#War Prep #1
label to_the_schoolyard:
"Go home, human!"
"That's right! You don't belong here!"
"Hiss! Stay away from me, No Fur!"
"Dark silent glares peered onto Yoah as he walked with Armeria around the schoolyard."   
??? "Are you all right, Yoah?"
yoah "Yeah..."
"Yoah gulped as he speaks." 
"There were even many students that lingers around this place."
"Some whispered around him, while others glared at him."
"Yoah's body began to shake as the beast's threatening words of 'kill him', 'slaughter him', and 'take him to the pack'."
"This school... this negative energy towards Yoah."
"What did the humans do to make this like this?"
??? "Yoah!"
yoah "Huh? Did you say something?"
??? "I said..."
??? "My name is Armeria! What's yours?"
yoah "Oh, it's..."
yoah "Yoah..."
a "Yoah... what a wonderful name!"
a "I look forward becoming your new friend!"
"Yoah's ears perked, as if he were a beast himself. He looked up at Armeria, who was smiling back at him."
"Him? This plant monster? As his new friend?"
"Suddenly, his lips began to quiver. Forming a broad look that reflected Armeria's face just now."
a "Hahahaha! Wonderful!"
yoah "What is it?" 
a "Oh, it's just that I didn't think a human would smile on their first day!"
a "They would usually be confused or scared!"
yoah "Why should I be scared? It's exciting to be around non-human beings!"
yoah "No, wait. It's like a dream come true! I've always wanted to be the main protagonist in a game!"
yoah "Hmm... that's not right."
a "Ehehehe! For a human being whose life is in dangerous, you sure are a cheery one!"
yoah "Well, yeah! It's not always good to be scared of everything!"
yoah "I should always be positive no matter what happens! Don't you think so too?"
a "..."
"Armeria gasped lightly and widen his eyes."
"Not the type of reaction Yoah expected to be. Did he say something wrong?"
a "The sun is about to set. You would need to meet the Union soon."
yoah "The Union?"
a "Yes, you know these people who surrounds you? They are known as the Union."
a "You'll learn more about them as we listen to their words, understand?"
y "Okay!"
"Yoah jumped gleefully. The 'Union', a name he had never heard before."
"How exciting! He thought to himself."

not_so_good_first_day:
a "Good night."
y "Good night!"
y "Hooray! Let's see what my dorm looks like!"
"*Creck...."
"As soon as Yoah walked inside of his dorm. His legs began to stumble."
y "What the heck?"
"His vision spun around, and his stomach began to churn badly."
"Something was about to come out and so, he were straight to the toilet."
y "Ughhhh..."
y "What's wrong with me?"
"*Bam!*"
a "Yoah! Are you all right?!"
y "Ahhh! Armeria! Can't you knock before you come in?!"
a "Now is not the time for privacy matters! I heard moaning coming from your dorm room!"
a "I thought that you were dying from something, so I got scared."
"Yoah widen his eyes, as he gazed upon Armeria's worried expression."
y "(Can non-humans make that kind of expression?)"
y "(Of course they would, you big dummy!)"
y "(Wouldn't they worry about extinction or something?!)"
"Suddenly, his stomach start churning again and then his face was back on the tiolet."
a "Ah... so I see what's going on."
"Armeria pondered as he observed Yoah."
a "You poor thing! I see that you can't handle this either!"
y "What do you- blech!"
a "I'll keep this brief. It's the territorial markings these beasts made in order to keep you away."
a "As much as I want to take to you to nurse, but it's dangerous for you to go at this time..."
a "Hmmm..."
a "A moment, please."
"As Armeria left, Yoah let out another very unpleasant throw up."
y "Ugh... so that explains the weird smell going around my dorm."
y "Just when I was enjoying my new li- blech!"
a "Come with me."
"Armeria wrapped Yoah's arm around his shoulder and slowly walked with him."
"Pressing his body with his, a sweet scent wavered around the air."
"Honey..."
"Bees would always make those as food for humans."
"Looking at Armeria, there were many leaves and flowers that surrounded his entire body."
"Surprisely, his body was very soft. As if were cuddling a teddy bear, Yoah never wanted to let that go."
"***"
a "I'm afraid this last minute notice had lead to this."
a "You're going to have sleep on my bed."
y "What?! In your bed?!"
y "Why that sounds..."
y "Exciting! Woohoo!"
"Just when Yoah was about to jump there, he came to a halt."
"He turned his head to Armeria, who stood there smiling at him."
"Yoah wasn't sure if he is really smiling sarcastically or not. It seem very real to him..."
a "What's wrong, Yoah? Don't you want to try my bed out?"
y "Where are you going to sleep in?"
a "Oh, me? Don't worry about me! Since I am a plant, I can sleep in dirt from our garden to keep my moisten my stems." 
a "Although there is a mini cabin inside that garden..."
a "Oh no! I should be there to protect you!"
"As Armeria mumbles to him, Yoah looks over at his bed."
"It seemed to be a normal bed with a blanket that is neatly made."
"Almost as if he were trying to sleep as a human being?"
a "It's getting late. You should get some sleep."
y "*Yawn* you're right, I should."
"He never would have thought that he would be a bit exhausted right now."
"He climbed onto the bed, closing his eyes up and he wasn't able to open them for a little while."
"***"
"Opening his eyes again, he was in an unfamiliar room."
"Confused, he rubbed his eyes to make sure that he wasn't dreaming."
a "Good morning!"
y "(Nope, it wasn't a dream. Thank goodness for that!"
a "Here! I made you some breakfast! Hope you don't mind!"
y "Oh boy! I bet it's one of your plant people's daily breakfast!"
y "..."
y "..."
"It was just a regular porridge with blueberries and bananas, with a elegant piece of flower petal on the center of it as well."
a "Sorry, would you like for me to take it back?"
y "No! No! I'm okay with it! Really!"
y "I was hoping to try some of your food today!"
a "Not really. There are many unfamiliar fruits, liquids, and insects you may not recognized."
a "Some of them might not look very appetizing to you either."
y "What? I rather tried it anyway!"
y "Don't you remember what I said yesterday? I'm here to learn on what's been happening in this academy!"
y "Food counts, right?"
a "Hahahaha!"
"A gentle laugh escaped from Armeria's mouth. Perhaps he was happy and surprised at the same time because of Yoah's words."
"He did described Yoah as an interesting person yesterday. Of course, many humans wouldn't be as typical as he is."
"They would panic and even ask a bunch of questions as Armeria described yesterday."
a "You should eat your breakfast soon. We have lots to talk about after this."
y "Oh, sorry!"
"Taking his first bite, it was very sweet and cold."
"Even the blueberries and bananas tasted very fresh too."
y "It's delicious, but it is a bit cold."
a "Sorry, plant people such as I am cannot handle too much heat. That's why your food is a bit too cold for you."
y "Oh, sorry! I didn't mean to offend you!"
y "It's really good!"
a "I wasn't offended. Others would say the same thing whenever I make food."
a "I can make something other than porridge, however, we plant people cannot digest solid food due to our weak stomach."
y "Really? Hmm... I thought that plants would make their own food after being watered and be basked in the sunlight?"
a "Ah, that too. That's the plant's daily routine during the daytimes."
a "I would often see many plant students that would bring bottles of water and bathe in the sunlight from before and after classes for their own survivals."
a "We shouldn't use up too much of our time right now. Eat up and get ready soon."
y "Oh, okay..."
"Yoah's head drooped down. Just when he was learning more about his non-human race."
y "(Oh well, maybe we'll talk about it another time.)"
"As Yoah ate more of his porridge, he noticed a big smile from Armeria."
"***"
#Seeing that it was extremely dangerous for Yoah to be exposed to a normal class and dormitory, Ohla suggested that Yoah studied in the library and stayed at the Union Chamber to rest until the situation in the dormitory and the academy had been controlled.
"After that, Yoah and Armeria stepped out of Union Chambers and began to walk together."
