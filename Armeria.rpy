"Go home, human!"
"That's right! You don't belong here!"
"Hiss! Stay away from me, No Fur!"
"Dark silent glares peered onto Yoah as he walked with Armeria around the schoolyard."   
??? "Are you all right, Yoah?"
yoah "Yeah..."
"Yoah gulped as he speaks." 
"There were even many students that lingers around this place."
"Some whispered around him, while others glared at him."
"Yoah's body began to shake as the beast's threatening words of 'kill him', 'slaughter him', and 'take him to the pack'."
"This school... this negative energy towards Yoah."
"What did the humans do to make this like this?"
??? "Yoah!"
yoah "Huh? Did you say something?"
??? "I said..."
??? "My name is Armeria! What's yours?"
yoah "Oh, it's..."
yoah "Yoah..."
a "Yoah... what a wonderful name!"
a "I look forward becoming your new friend!"
"Yoah's ears perked, as if he were a beast himself. He looked up at Armeria, who was smiling at him."
"Him? As his new friend?"
"Suddenly, his lips began to quiver. Forming a broad look that reflected Armeria's face just now."
a "Hahahaha! Wonderful!"
yoah "What is it?" 
a "Oh, it's just that I didn't think a human would smile on their first day!"
a "They would usually be confused or scared!"
yoah "Why should I be scared? It's exciting to be around non-human beings!"
yoah "No, wait. It's like a dream come true! I've always wanted to be the main protagonist in a game!"
yoah "Hmm... that's not right."
a "Ehehehe! For someone whose life is dangerous, you sure are a cheery one!"
